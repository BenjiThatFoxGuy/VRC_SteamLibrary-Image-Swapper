1) Open steam, go to library and right click on VRChat.  Go to Manage->Browse Local Files
2) Unzip and place the Image swapper files into this folder
3) Open config.ini in a text editor and place the path of your photos directory. EX: photos = C:\Users\user\Pictures\VRChat
4) In steam again right click VRChat and go to properties.  In the launch options box insert "run.bat %COMMAND%" **before** any launch options
5) Run VRChat and enjoy seeing your screenshots or skebs or whatever else on your EAC screen!

# Extra info
You can adjust the timeout in the run.bat, if it's too low it may not update the picture before vrchat launches.
The image it chooses can be an image within a folder in the root folder.  EX: VRCHAT/2022-07/image.png
